Cyber Lens was honestly a good experience. I learned a lot while working on it, especially 
by fixing things that didn’t work the first time. Some parts were confusing and took time to 
understand, but that’s part of the learning. Overall, it felt like a real project, and I’m glad 
I contributed. Thanks for sticking with it till the end.
